    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you want to use Bootleg on full datasets. You can also use Bootleg in annotator mode:\n",

    "To understand how Bootleg performs on more natural language than we find in Wikipedia, we hand label the mentions and corresponding entities in 50 questions sampled from the [Natural Questions dataset (Google)](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions).

    "Some of the errors Bootleg makes is predicting too general of a candidate (e.g. Oregon State Beavers instead of Oregon State Beavers baseball). Other errors are due to ambiguous sentences (e.g. \"cast of characters in fiddler on the roof\" -> should this be the movie or the musical?). Finally another bucket of errors suggests that we need to boost certain training signals -- this is an area we're actively pursuing in Bootleg with an investigation of model guidability!"
