    "- Data for RSS500 [here](https://bootleg-emb.s3.amazonaws.com/data/rss500.tar.gz).\n",
    "- Entity profile information [here](https://bootleg-emb.s3.amazonaws.com/entity_db.tar.gz)\n",
    "- Pretrained Bootleg model and config [here](https://bootleg-emb.s3.amazonaws.com/models/2020_08_25/bootleg_wiki.tar.gz)\n",
    "- Embedding data [here](https://bootleg-emb.s3.amazonaws.com/emb_data.tar.gz)\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, you can run the command below (from the `tutorials` directory) to download all the above files and unpack them to the provided directory. It will take several minutes to download all the files. \n",
    "\n",
    "    bash download_all.sh <NAME_OF_DIRECTORY_TO_SAVE_DATA>\n",
