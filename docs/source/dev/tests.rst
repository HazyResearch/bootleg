Testing
=======

We use pytest_ to run our tests. Our tests are all located in the ``test`` directory in the repo, and are meant to be run *after* installing_ Bootleg locally.

To run our tests, just run::

    $ make test

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
.. _installing: install.html
