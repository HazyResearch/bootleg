Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a Changelog`_ and this project adheres to `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_ conventions. The maintainers will create a git tag for each release and increment the version number found in `bootleg/\_version.py`_ accordingly. We release tagged versions to `PyPI`_ automatically using `GitHub Actions`_.

.. note::
    Bootleg is still under active development and APIs may still change rapidly. Until we release v1.0.0, changes in MINOR version indicate backward incompatible changes.
